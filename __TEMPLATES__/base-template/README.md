# Base template

This template should not be used directly, it provides the base setup files. Templates overwrite these files, fully replacing them.

_Q. When should I update these template files?_

Only if you want to share common functionality across all child spas. But you should be aware that if a template overrides any file, you will need to manually make the same change in that location too.

Before making changes to these files reach out on the **#web-experience-dev** channel.
